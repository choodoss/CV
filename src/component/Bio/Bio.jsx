                I am a Frontend Developer with in-depth knowledge and skills in web application development. I recently successfully completed the GoIT courses. I have 16 years of experience in the commercial sector, but I am eager to transition my career to application development, which inspires continuous growth and challenges. I am open to learning and acquiring new knowledge, and I am ready to constantly expand my skills in this field.

                I have significant experience in the commercial sector in various positions, including managerial roles. I have successfully managed teams of over 60 employees, led multiple projects, and organized events with varying attendance ranging from 20 to 30,000 individuals. I have worked both independently and collaboratively, allowing me to enhance my project management skills and achieve set goals.

                My determination, motivation, and desire for continuous self-improvement complement my professional persona. I am ready to embrace new challenges and confidently move forward in application development.
